**25.Apr.2025** - 

**24.Apr.2025** - started today with combining conditionals and utilizing __name__ == "__main__" for file execution. Also created a rock,paper, scissors game. Will move onto lists for today but running out of time. ;)

**23.Apr.2025** - began creating a python fundamentals drill kit after creating accounts with leetcode and hackerrank.  Several gaps were noticed from basics taught in Mimo compared to the problems on LeetCode and HackerRank. Drill kit will be created to learn and practice concepts up to looping functions (current Mimo progress) and also expanded on later as I progress.

**23.Apr.2025** - some time later I found I needed to install the Python runtime and interpreter on my machine for my code to run in VSC. After getting that squared away the code ran like a charm.  So now that I have a way to verify the "self checks" I do from this point on, that should help a bit.  Finalized code uploaded.
