**25.May.2025** - I haven't updated in awhile - First sick during my birthday and now again this past week, and of course we have been circulating it through the family.  Should be back on track tomorrow. Also noting that I am refreshing on SQL in conjunction with this by splitting my time between the two with a 3:1 ratio (Python as Primary). I don't suspect too much trouble with SQL. Will pursue certifications on Python and SQL this year, maybe SQL first being I'm more comfortable with that.  We'll see.

**1.May.2025** - Didn't update yesterday but began functions on Mimo.  Will perform the list project today too depending on how I feel - have had fever for the last two days...not the birthday present I had envisioned :). I don't think I'll make the list project today. I have been on a sidequest today looking at call diagrams for py and real-world usage.  I understand the usage of modules and their characteristics.

**29.Apr.2025** - Took a break for the weekend and will have another break for my birthday tomorrow.  Will do best to finsh lists today and start a new project. We'll see if time will allow. Update: finished lists just in time.  Will expand on lists and advanced list loops tomorrow in a personal project. Functions are next but I'll need to skill check before I move ahead.

**25.Apr.2025** - updated the rock paper scissors to include a win counter and track.  Print added at the bottom to track score and uploaded to GH. Continuing with lists now and following along with VSC.  No issues with VSC now that I have aligned the profile with Python.  

**24.Apr.2025** - started today with combining conditionals and utilizing __name__ == "__main__" for file execution. Also created a rock,paper, scissors game. Will move onto lists for today but running out of time. ;)

**23.Apr.2025** - began creating a python fundamentals drill kit after creating accounts with leetcode and hackerrank.  Several gaps were noticed from basics taught in Mimo compared to the problems on LeetCode and HackerRank. Drill kit will be created to learn and practice concepts up to looping functions (current Mimo progress) and also expanded on later as I progress.

**23.Apr.2025** - some time later I found I needed to install the Python runtime and interpreter on my machine for my code to run in VSC. After getting that squared away the code ran like a charm.  So now that I have a way to verify the "self checks" I do from this point on, that should help a bit.  Finalized code uploaded.
