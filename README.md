# PythonLearning
A place to upload my projects I create as I learn Python
23.Apr.2025 - began creating a python fundamentals drill kit after creating accounts with leetcode and hackerrank.  Several gaps were noticed from basics taught in Mimo compared to the problems on LeetCode and HackerRank. Drill kit will be created to learn and practice concepts up to looping functions (current Mimo progress) and also expanded on later as I progress.
